# Neural network supercointegrated pairs trading. 

View supercointegrated_nn_part1.ipynb for part 1 which implements in Python:
1. Pulling from the IEX Cloud API
2. Running cointegration tests to form supercointegrated pairs from the S&P 500 IEX Sandbox data.
3. Formation of rolling conditional voltaility thresholds for the pairs.
